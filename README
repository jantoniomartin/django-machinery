django-machinery
================

**django-machinery** is a set of Django applications for project managing,
that I made for the company that I work for. The company is a machinery
factory, and the models are specific for this domain and suited to this
company workflow.

The applications that form **django-machinery** include the following:

  * _crm_, for customer and supplier relationship management.
  * _pm_, for project management.
  * _dm_, ultra-simple document management.
  * _wm_, for warehouse management.
  * _om_, for order management.
